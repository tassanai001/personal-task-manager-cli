# Task Completion Checklist
- Ensure new constitution or specs align with SDD flow (conform to plan/spec/tasks templates).
- Run repo-specific scripts if applicable (e.g., `update-agent-context.sh`) to keep agent guidance in sync.
- Update Markdown docs (README, CHANGELOG) whenever CLI features change.
- Run acceptance/unit tests once CLI implementation exists; currently no codebase tests are defined.
