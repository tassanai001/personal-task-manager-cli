# Style & Conventions
- Follow Spec-Driven Development workflow: use /specify → /plan → /tasks → implementation; keep changes aligned with generated tasks.
- Constitution will define principle-focused rules (offline-only CLI, atomic file writes, TDD with acceptance/unit tests, docs updates).
- No specific language style guides yet; expect CLI code to emphasise JSON output, deterministic behavior, and offline operation.
- Keep documentation in Markdown; tests required for each CLI command; track changes in README/CHANGELOG once implementation exists.
