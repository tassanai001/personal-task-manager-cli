# Feature Specification: Offline Task CLI MVP

**Feature Branch**: `001-users-can-add`  
**Created**: 2025-09-29  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Users can add, list, complete, and delete tasks; Tasks have a title, description, priority (low/medium/high), and status; Data persists to a local JSON file; No authentication required"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "store tasks" without path or format), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Default data location and filesystem permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-29

- Q: Should the CLI support reversing a completed task back to `todo`, or are tasks immutable once marked done? ‚Üí A: Allow re-opening via flag on `ptm complete`

---

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A solo operator launches the offline CLI to capture and track personal tasks. When they mark items complete they can also undo a completion via the same command if they finish prematurely. They add new work items with a title, optional description, and priority, list tasks to review progress, mark items complete once done, and delete tasks that are no longer needed, all without leaving the terminal or connecting to a network service.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the task store JSON exists or is creatable, **When** the user runs `ptm add --title "Write report" --description "Draft Q3 summary" --priority high`, **Then** the CLI confirms creation, persists the task with status `todo`, and returns exit code 0.
2. **Given** a task with status `todo`, **When** the user runs `ptm complete <id>`, **Then** the CLI updates the task to status `done`, stamps `completedAt`, and the change is reflected when listing tasks.
3. **Given** multiple tasks in different priorities, **When** the user runs `ptm list --priority low`, **Then** only low-priority tasks are shown in both human-readable and `--json` formats.
4. **Given** a stale or unnecessary task, **When** the user runs `ptm delete <id>`, **Then** the CLI removes the task from the JSON file and confirms removal.

### Edge Cases
- Missing task store file: CLI creates the JSON file at the default local path (`~/.ptm/tasks.json`) before proceeding.
- Invalid priority flag or missing title: CLI rejects the command with a validation error message and non-zero exit code.
- Concurrent edits or corrupted JSON: CLI warns, preserves a backup, and guides the user to resolve the conflict without losing data.
- Attempting to complete or delete a nonexistent task ID: CLI surfaces an error and leaves stored data unchanged.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: CLI MUST allow users to add a task with a required title, optional description, and priority flag (`low`, `medium`, `high`).
- **FR-002**: CLI MUST list tasks with filters for `status`, `priority`, and a `--json` option for machine-readable output.
- **FR-003**: CLI MUST update a task's status to `done` when the user completes it, record `completedAt`, and support an `--undo` flag on `ptm complete` to revert the task to `todo` and clear `completedAt`.
- **FR-004**: CLI MUST delete a specified task by ID and confirm removal to the user.
- **FR-005**: CLI MUST persist all task mutations to a single local JSON file using atomic write semantics and create the file if missing.
- **FR-006**: CLI MUST operate entirely offline with no network or authentication requirements.
- **FR-007**: CLI MUST enforce validation errors with descriptive stderr output and non-zero exit codes when inputs are invalid.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Task**: Represents an individual work item with properties `id`, `title`, `description`, `priority`, `status`, `createdAt`, and `completedAt`.
- **Task Store**: The local JSON document (`~/.ptm/tasks.json` by default) that stores an array of tasks and enforces schema integrity and atomic writes.
